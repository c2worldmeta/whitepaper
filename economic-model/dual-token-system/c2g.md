# $C2G

$C2G is not only an ERC-20 token built on the blockchain, but also the first-stage general-purpose token within C².WORLD, which is mainly used for daily transaction consumption.

There is no limit to the number of $C2G tokens that can be issued. The first $100 million $C2G tokens issued by the platform will be used to provide ongoing liquidity to trading pairs. Thereafter, digital citizens can only receive $C2G tokens within C².WORLD.

Digital citizens with $C2G can

* Trade on the C².WORLD marketplace. It costs $C2G to purchase and lease NFT assets such as digital human shapes, equipment, and universes.
* Spend $C2G to mint a multiverse or asset into an NFT.
* Entering a land or universe that requires a ticket. Some tickets require $C2G to purchase.
* Post a corresponding bounty, offering $C2G to entrust other players to craft the assets and multiverses they need.
* Set up challenges in your own multiverse and use $C2G as a reward to attract more players to play.
* A certain amount of $C2G is consumed when upgrading equipment.

## Token distribution

90% of the $C2G tokens obtained by the platform from purchases will be burnt, with the exception of retaining a small portion of the revenue as a handling fee, the rest will be provided to referrers to reward their contributions.

## coin minting

According to the development stage of C².WORLD and the dynamic of the number of users, the minting of $C2G tokens will be moderately increased.
