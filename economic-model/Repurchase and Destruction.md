# Repurchase and Destruction

{% hint style="success" %}
**To ensure full transparency**, the buyback and destruction of $C2C will be done automatically by a tool fully controlled by smart contracts.
{% endhint %}

## Repurchase Rules

The entire platform **30% of quarterly profits** will be added to the buyback pool to buy back $C2C. The smart contract will continuously check the average price of $C2C over the past 72 hours. As long as the price is below the 72-hour average price, the smart contract is triggered to exchange funds in the pool for $C2C at random times.

## Destruction plan

We will periodically destroy $C2C.
