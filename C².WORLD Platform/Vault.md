# Vault

Open up the revenue contract of digital asset swap in the multi-sub universe, and some cores are similar to DEX.

## Trade

Transactions in the Vault will be charged a handling fee of 0.1% of the transaction amount. If you hold $C2C, you can choose to use $C2C to deduct the transaction fee and enjoy a 25% discount (temporary). The entire transaction is decentralized, and the tokens traded do not pass through anyone's hands.

## Staking

Staking are a way for us to reward digital citizens for having a long term mindset and locking up their $C2C tokens. By pledging your $C2C tokens, you will be able to receive $C2C rewards when you lock your tokens through staking. In the future, pledging $C2C will provide you with DAO voting and voice rights.

### Liquidity mining

Players can stake their tokens to liquidity pools for liquidity mining to get token rewards. Staking $C2C for liquidity mining can get higher returns. Liquidity mining may incur free losses.

## Foundation

The referrer gets a profit from the referee's consumption, and 7% of the 4.25% platform fee charged by the platform will be given to the referrer. 50% of the handling fee will be allocated to the world mining pool as a reward for token holders who staking $C2C tokens, and the remaining 50% will be allocated to the "Foundation". The foundation will provide creators of high-quality content and games with $C2C as an incentive to build a multiverse with a good ecology.

## Private mining pool

When certain conditions are met (higher requirements for land scale, number of people, contribution, pledge, etc.), TinyVerse can apply to be upgraded to a sub-universe. The default limit of the sub-universe fan group is 128. The sub-universe can issue FT by itself. The lord can pledge his minted currency and governance token $C2C to the private mining pool to create a liquidity mining pool. The TVL of a single pool must reach more than 5000u. The sub-universe can be upgraded to a sub-universe when a higher condition is reached, and the issued NFT or FT can be freely traded outside CÂ².WORLD.
