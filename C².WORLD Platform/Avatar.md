### Durable

When the Digiman completes the income task in C².WORLD, the equipment durability will be consumed. When the endurance is exhausted, the Digiman cannot continue to receive the income mission, and it needs to wait for a period of time to maintain the equipment to restore the durability. Each task consumes 1 point of durability. The durability recovery and durability limit of each piece of equipment are related to the current equipment star rating. Digital citizens can send equipment for free repairs to restore the durability of the equipment. After a certain number of free repairs, the equipment will wear out, reducing the maximum durability of the equipment. Wear and tear equipment can be repaired through materials to restore the upper limit of durability.

### Synthetic upgrade

Combine two pieces of equipment of the same star rating to obtain a higher star rating (this operation may also fail). The newly synthesized equipment has a cooldown period, during which it cannot be used to synthesize equipment with a higher star rating. The cooling period for newly synthesized two-star equipment is five days. The higher the star rating of the newly synthesized equipment, the longer the cooling period. The higher the star rating of the equipment, the longer the cooling time of synthesis. During the cooling of synthesis, except that it can no longer be used for synthesis, other functions such as rental, sale and use are not affected.
